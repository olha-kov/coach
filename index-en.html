              <p>
                A professional coach with over 300 hours of practice since 2021.
                I work with leaders, entrepreneurs, and specialists who are
                going through periods of change and striving for clarity, inner
                support, and steady growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                My approach combines the depth of psychology, business
                structure, and genuine humanity. My clients achieve tangible
                results — new contracts, 3x income growth, confident leadership,
                and restored life balance. I help find inner support, make bold
                decisions, and build a life that truly resonates.

              <p>
                We will contact you to clarify your coaching goal: what result
                you want to achieve and what changes to implement in your life
                or business. Then we conduct a short introductory meeting and a
                trial session, during which I answer your questions and we
                together determine if the format suits you. After that, we
                decide on collaboration, sign a contract formalizing our work,
                and you make payment via a convenient method: bank transfer or
                payment system link. Sessions can be recorded for personal use
                if desired.
